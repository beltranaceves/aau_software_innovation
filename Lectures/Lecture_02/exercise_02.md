Exercise 1 is a follow-up to Exercise 0. In this exercise, we will consider your semester project:

What problem are you working on?
Explain what type of innovation you aim for (Table 1.1 in Essence).
What will be the keystones in your design? What will make your design stand out?
Who will benefit from it? What value will you create?
Where will it be used? How will it create change?
Characterize your problem or solution challenges in terms of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (Section 1.2 in Essence).
Do you consider your project to be mainly demand-pull or technology-push? (Section 1.2 in Essence).
Will roles be relevant? How? When? What are the pros and cons of roles?
