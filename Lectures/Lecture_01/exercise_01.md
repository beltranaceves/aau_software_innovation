Exercise 0 is all about innovation opportunities for you this semester.

Look at the semester project description in the study regulations for your education. See if your topic is related to one or more of the following trends and forces:

Do you see trends in technology that might be related to your topic?
Do you see trends in legislation, society, culture, and economy that might be linked to your topic?
Do you see new forces in industry and markets, new needs and demands, new products, and new conditions relevant to your topic?
How can such trends and forces create innovation opportunities in your project?
